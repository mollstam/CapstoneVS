# CapstoneVS
A Visual Studio Extension to show disassembly using Capstone (http://www.capstone-engine.org/).

I created this extensions since I hade some problem with Visual Studio to display disassembly of
inlined ARM64 assembly, which was simply being shown as 4 byte literal numbers.

Please note that this extension is very rough and somewhat hard-coded to what I need it to do.
However, it remains quite hackable so if you want to change the behaviour to fit what you need
it should be quite easy. In the future it would of course be nice for it to be configurable
so you wouldn't have to recode it. :)

## Install

Grab [a release](https://github.com/mollstam/CapstoneVS/releases) or pull and compile.
